Same as HelloWorldSpec sample except the HelloServiceImpl is now managed via Spring Dynamic Modules.

1. Build all four projects.
2. Install spec.jar, service.jar and client.jar
3. Start each of the bundles.
4. As an exercise, stop client.jar and notice the message. Start client.jar.
5. Install service2.jar.
6. Stop service.jar
7. Start service2.jar.
8. Stop client.jar. Notice the message. Cool!
